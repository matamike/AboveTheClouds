Summary: This is a 3rd person obstacle course game, set in a cloud oriented environment.
As a player you are given the options to try different difficulty modes or create and try custom maps.
The maps contain grid shaped areas that the player has to traverse until reaching a large tile that serves the purpose of a checkpoint.
Some random maps contain multiple checkpoints. Custom maps allow a single grid mapping.




Tile Types: 

1) Simple Tile: This is a regular tile without any additional effect.

2) Empty Tile: This serves as an empty area (gap) inside the mapping.

3) Spinning Tile: This tile activates upon touch and spins while trying to push gradually the player out of it.
   The Player has to move accordingly inside that tile, while it spins or risk moving to another tile.

4) Drop Tile: This tile activates upon touch and slowly falls. Remaining on that tile for more than needed will result in falling from the platform.
   The Player has to leave this tile as soon as possible.

5) Bouncy Tile: This tile will activate upon touch and will charge the spring, that will push the player to the sky.
   This particular tile can be used to power jump to other tiles using its feature or simply await the effect to stop and move to other tiles.

Hints/Tips: The play area setup is densely clouded, which means that up to certain degree the player will have limited visibility, which is a key factor.
            The idea behind the playstyle is to patiently utilize the motion of the player, while considering that due to limited visibility mistakes will
            lead to falling and losing.




Creator:

The creator is another aspect of the game. Predefined templates are present by visiting one of the portals and enter the creator.
Inside the creator area the player will be introduced to the creator process and can pick several different fixed size mapping that can be modified to your liking.

Those mappings can be tested again through a different portal inside the Hub area (starting area). 
As soon as you finish up with editing the mappings, you can visit the hub
and use the respective portal to select the mapping of your choice and try it out in the real environment.

Hint: You can try the mapping inside the creator, in every step of the way and help shape it better.
